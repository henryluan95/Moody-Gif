# Moody Gif

**Moody Gif is a hackathon project that I worked on with one of my classmates at BrainStation**

Moody Gif is an application where you get a gif of your choice by simply typing in a keyword. (Random button is provided if you want to fancy a surprise)

 During the process of building this project, my classmate and I practiced using BEM, SASS, and APIs. We were given a list of different APIs and were asked to make an application around that API within 24 hours. We decided to use Pair Programming technique to overcome the time constraint aspect of the challenge. 

The result is a fully responsive and functional web application with a fantastic design.
